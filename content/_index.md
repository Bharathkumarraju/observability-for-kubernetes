# Monitoring & Observability for Kubernetes

Hello, my name is [Tom Riley](https://thomasriley.co.uk). I am a Cloud & Platform Engineer who is passionate about Monitoring & Observability. I have created this website as a way of sharing my learnings from monitoring Kubernetes.

Please use the navigation on the left hand side to start learning about Monitoring & Observability for Kubernetes.

I suggest reading the [**Introduction**](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk/introduction/) to learn about this website and prerequisites before progressing to learn about monitoring Kubernetes.

So far this website has chapters on:

* Deploying [**Prometheus**](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk/prometheus/) to Kuberneres with Prometheus Operator and scaling to add long term storage of metrics using Thanos
* [**Monitoring Kubernetes**](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk/monitoring-kubernetes/) with Prometheus

I will be adding more content over time and also improving and updating existing chapters.
