# Monitoring & Observability for Kubernetes

Please use the navigation on the left hand side to start learning about Monitoring & Observability for Kubernetes.

I suggest reading the **Introduction** to learn about this website and prerequisites before begging to learn about monitoring Kubernetes.

So far this website has chapters on:

* Deploying [**Prometheus**](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk/prometheus/) to Kuberneres with Prometheus Operator and scaling to add long term storage of metrics using Thanos
* [**Monitoring Kubernetes**](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk/monitoring-kubernetes/) with Prometheus

I will be adding more content over time and also improving and updating existing chapters.
