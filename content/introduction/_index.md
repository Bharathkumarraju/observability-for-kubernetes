### Chapter 1

# Introduction

### What is this site?

* I wanted a place to store all my notes and learnings about Monitoring & Observability working with Kubernetes and containerisation.
* Instead of maintaining a private set of notes, I created this site so I can give back to the community.
* If you spot a mistake or wish to propose a change, please raise a [pull request](https://github.com/thomasriley/observability-for-kubernetes) or [contact me](mailto:contact@thomasriley.co.uk)
* I hope you find this useful!

### Who am I?

* My name is Tom Riley and I am a Cloud & Platform Engineer who is passionate about Monitoring & Observability. 
* Please see my website [thomasriley.co.uk](https://thomasriley.co.uk) to learn more or if you wish to get in touch.
