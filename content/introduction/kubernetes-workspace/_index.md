These tutorials assume you have access to a Kubernetes environment with full cluster admin privileges. If you need to find access to Kubernetes there are a few options I would suggest:

* Create a [free Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/free/) with $300 in credit and use [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/). Kubernetes Engine is not a free service but you can use the free credit to pay for the service.
* Create a [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/) account and use their [Managed Kubernetes Service](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/). This is not a free service and there is no free credit easily available.
* Use [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or [KIND](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) for running Kubernetes locally on your machine.
