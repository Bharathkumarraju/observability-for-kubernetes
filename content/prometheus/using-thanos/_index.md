The [Thanos Project](https://github.com/improbable-eng/thanos) turns Prometheus into a highly available metrics platform with unlimited metrics storage.

* Global query view of all metrics from as many Prometheus instances as you require.
* Long term storage of metrics.
* High availability of Prometheus.

In this section we will look at how to deploy Thanos alongside Prometheus.
