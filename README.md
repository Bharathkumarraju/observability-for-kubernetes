# observability-for-kubernetes

This is the open source repository for the website [observability.thomasriley.co.uk](https://observability.thomasriley.co.uk) where I have been documenting my learnings from monitoring Kubernetes.

This is still a work in progress and I will be improving and adding more content to this website over time.
